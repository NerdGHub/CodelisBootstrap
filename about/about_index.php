                    <p>At Codelis, we believe that a graduate’s first job should be more than just a paycheck—it should
                        be a launchpad. We’re a recruitment agency dedicated to connecting talented software engineering
                        graduates with ambitious startups and smaller companies where they can make a real impact from
                        day one. <br /> <br />

                        We know that early career steps can shape entire careers. That’s why we remove the noise, cut
                        through the job-hunting grind, and focus on creating genuine, high-quality matches between
                        candidates and employers. Our process is simple, transparent, and built to save time—for both
                        sides.<br /> <br />

                        For graduates, Codelis is the bridge between potential and opportunity. We give you direct
                        access to innovative companies who value your skills and fresh perspective—without the endless
                        application loops. For companies, we deliver candidates who are not only technically skilled but
                        also hungry to grow alongside your business.<br /> <br />

                        Whether you’re a graduate ready to make your mark or a business looking for the next rising
                        star, Codelis is here to make the connection that counts.<br /> <br />

                        Your career. Your company. Connected.
